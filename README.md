# Pac-Man-Python

Hi, this was my first project in Python and I know it is very disorderly.
Here you have all the artworks for the menu, info and levels + the background songs and SFX.
Also, there is a "Button" class too.
The rest are the PNGs for the Pacman itself, ghosts and (weird) fruit.
Hope you like it!
